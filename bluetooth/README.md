Bluetooth communication

Questions:
1) Record the RSSI (and TX power if you are able) at different distances
2) Plot RSSI vs. distance
3) What is the relationship between RSSI and distance?

the relationship seems to be a linear decline
connection fell off after about 12.5 meters
4) If you are recording the TX power, when does it change?
power was not measured
5) Without moving the Raspberry Pi or ground station computer, record the RSSI (and TX power) with each material in between.  Which material has the biggest impact?
Used: Backpack, liquids, dog cage, steel mesh fence
steel mesh fence inhibited the transfer the most
6) Record RSSI (and TX power) as you move around with your Pi.  How do walls and other large objects impact the signal?
They inhibit the signal
